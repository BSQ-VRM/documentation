## What is Locomotion?

- Locomotion is the term used to describe how your avatar's legs move when no trackers are available. Allows your avatar to walk along with your headset.

## Available options

-  Leg Swivel: This is an important one! Adjusting this value can fix issues where some avatars may bend their legs to the side. This value changes the angle which the knees go when crouching for example.
