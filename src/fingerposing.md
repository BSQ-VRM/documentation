## How do I Configure Finger Posing?
- Each subcategory contains a finger on the avatar's hand. Each one has 4 options.
	- Distal: The last joint on your finger, your finger tips
	- Intermediate: The middle joint on your finger.
	- Proximal: The first joint on your finger.
	- Proximal Horizontal Angle: The horizontal angle of the first joint of the finger, useful for making splayed hands.

## Future Features
- Bind finger poses to different events (Buttons, Triggers, Scoring, etc...).
