# IK
*AKA. Inverse Kinematics*

## What is IK?

- IK describes the way that your avatar can move it's waist and elbows without knowing where they actually are.

## Available options

- Leg Swivel: This is an important one! Adjusting this value can fix issues where some avatars may bend their legs to the side. This value changes the angle which the knees go when crouching for example.
- Arm Swivel: Similar to leg swivel but not as important. This value adjusts the angle that you elbows go in when bringing your arms towards your body.
- Body Stiffness: This value determines how stiff your torso will be. You can see how this value affects your avatar by leaning forwards and backwards with a low and high stiffness.
- Shoulder Rotation Weight: This value will lower the shoulders the higher the value.
- Wrist Twist Fix & Shoulder Twist Fix: These values do not appear to do much but they help calm your arms when moving in weird angles.
- Ground Offset: This value is also very useful for avatars that are much taller than you. This allows you to offset where your avatar's feet are vertically.
